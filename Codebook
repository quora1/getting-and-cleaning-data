Prodecure:

1) Opening files and investigating their dimentions
2)Merging all similar data using rbind() command
	subjects_test with subjects_train
	X_test with X_train
	y_test with y_train
3)Extracting from the X dataset only observations on means and standard deviations using grep function and regular expression language, assigning features their names from features.txt file as well as activities from file activity_labels.txt
4) Merging the modified X file with y and subjects, the new dataset has 180 rows (30 subjects*6 activities
5) Generating new dataset with averages per activity per subject using melt and dcast functions and saving it in a txt format.


Datasets 

(corresponding to different stages of the procedure; initial, intermediary and final):

2)--> x_train, x_test (actual measurements), y_train, y_test, (activities) subject_train , 	subject_test (subjects). For dimentions, see comments inside run_analysis.R script
3)--> X (product of merging x_train and x_test), features.txt file containing description of 	features and file activity_labels.txt with labels of activities.
4) -->X, y (product of merging y_train, y_test) and subjects (product of merging 	subject_train , subject_test). The 3 datasets are merged into "data" dataset.
5) -->data.mean is the final dataset with averages per activity and per subject build based on 	"data" dataset.


Variables:

Subjects (from 1 to 30) - identfier 1
Activities (6 activities per subject) - identfier 2
Features ( 86 - columns corresponding all the different measurements par activity and per 	subject)
